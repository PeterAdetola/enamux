## Project Overview

Originally constructed in 2006 as a healthcare facility, the Rangers Hotel project is a strategic adaptive reuse design commissioned by the Government of Enugu State. The firm was engaged to assess the structural integrity of the existing building and develop a comprehensive design framework to convert its intended use from a hospital to a hotel without any demolition of the existing structure.

## Structural Assessment and Adaptation

A detailed structural assessment was carried out to evaluate the building's load-carrying capacity, material performance, and suitability for reprogramming. The findings informed a design approach that preserved the original structural system while enabling its safe adaptation to hospitality requirements, demonstrating the firm's ability to unlock new value from dormant assets through engineering judgment rather than replacement.

## New Addition Design

The scope also included the design of an additional three-storey structure within the site, conceived to complement the existing building. A raft foundation system was adopted at the design stage to ensure uniform load distribution and long-term stability in response to the site conditions and increased structural demand.

## Performance Monitoring Strategy

To enhance long-term performance monitoring and accommodate structural movement, expansion joints were incorporated into the design. These joints serve both functional and diagnostic roles—allowing controlled movement while enabling early identification of potential structural distress within a highly robust structural scheme.

## Project Significance

This project exemplifies the firm's capacity to reimagine and revive existing structures through intelligent assessment and design—transforming underutilized buildings into viable, future-ready assets without unnecessary demolition or waste.
