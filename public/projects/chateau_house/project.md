## Project Overview

Chateau House is a rare example of residential architecture operating at a scale and structural intensity more commonly associated with major commercial or high-rise developments. Designed as a private residence, the project pushes the boundaries of residential structural engineering, demonstrating the firm's capacity to resolve extreme loading, poor ground conditions, and unconventional spatial demands within a single coordinated design.

## Structural Scale and Loading

Although the building rises only three storeys, its sheer magnitude is exceptional, occupying a footprint of approximately 150 m by 130 m. The scale of the structure results in foundation-level column loads reaching up to 4,000KN, a level of loading seldom encountered in residential projects. These forces demanded a foundation solution beyond conventional shallow systems.

## Foundation Strategy

Subsurface investigations revealed highly unfavourable soil conditions, characterized by clay strata with negative skin friction potential and the presence of groundwater at or near ground surface. Under such conditions, shallow foundations were unsuitable. The structural solution therefore adopted a pile foundation system designed primarily for end bearing, ensuring that the heavy column loads are safely transferred to competent strata below while mitigating drag effects caused by negative skin friction. Designing piles under these constraints required careful consideration of pile–soil interaction, long-term settlement behaviour, groundwater influence, and construction feasibility.

## Superstructure Design

The superstructure is equally demanding. The building accommodates exceptionally large internal spaces, with most rooms spanning up to 20 metres, an uncommon requirement even in commercial buildings. These spans are achieved with deep first-floor beams approximately 1.2 metres in depth, providing the stiffness and robustness necessary to control deflection and vibration at such lengths. The structure further maintains a uniform headroom of approximately 6 metres across all floors, reinforcing the sense of openness while increasing structural demand.

## Special Features

Adding to the complexity, the design incorporates a swimming pool at the second-floor level, introducing significant imposed loads, water retention considerations, and serviceability requirements that had to be seamlessly integrated into the primary structural system. A drive-in ramp to the first floor further complicates load paths, requiring precise coordination between inclined and vertical structural elements.

Crowning the structure is a curved solid roof system, a departure from conventional flat residential roofs. This element demanded meticulous detailing to manage thrust forces, continuity, and load redistribution while maintaining durability and architectural intent.

## Project Significance

Chateau House stands as a benchmark in large-scale residential structural engineering, a project where extreme loads, poor soil conditions, groundwater presence, long spans, and architectural ambition converge. It is a clear demonstration that with sound engineering judgment, rigorous analysis, and innovative foundation strategy, even the most challenging site and loading conditions can be transformed into a stable, enduring, and refined residential structure.
