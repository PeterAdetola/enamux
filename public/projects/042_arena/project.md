## Project Overview

The 042 Arena, Enugu State, is a 20,000-seater, fully enclosed multi-purpose arena designed to host sports events, concerts, and large-scale exhibitions. The facility incorporates an enclosed roof system and is further enhanced by an underground parking facility accommodating over 2000 vehicles, a feature that significantly elevates the project's structural and spatial demands.

## Structural Challenges

Introducing a subterranean parking structure beneath an arena of this magnitude transforms the project into one of the most structurally demanding building types. The underground parking required the structure to resist earth pressures, surcharge loads, and groundwater effects, while simultaneously supporting the immense dead and live loads generated by the arena bowl, roof system, and high crowd occupancy above. Designing a large public assembly structure over an excavated volume of this scale demands precise control of load paths and deformation behaviour.

## Design Strategy

The arena is organized on a 15-metre architectural grid, selected to achieve expansive, column-free interior spaces while maintaining structural efficiency and constructability. This grid defines the alignment of columns, transfer elements, and seating tiers, ensuring rational load flow from the superstructure down to the foundations.

### Movement Control

To address thermal movement, long-span behaviour, and differential settlement—particularly critical in a structure of this footprint—strategically placed expansion joints were introduced across the arena. These joints allow controlled movement, reduce the accumulation of internal stresses, and localize potential structural distress, ensuring that any movement-related effects are isolated rather than propagated across the entire building. This approach enhances long-term durability and simplifies structural monitoring and maintenance.

### Foundation System

Given the magnitude of loading and the uncertainty associated with subsurface conditions, the arena was designed to perform reliably on poor soil profiles. A high-capacity piled foundation system supporting a raft foundation was adopted to control settlement and provide stability for both the arena and the underground parking structure under extreme loading conditions.

### Seating and Roof Structure

The seating bowl incorporates raked floor systems, engineered to safely accommodate large crowd loads while maintaining stiffness, vibration control, and clear sightlines—critical performance requirements for modern arenas.

Spanning approximately 250 metres, the roof structure is resolved using a space-frame system, providing the efficiency, redundancy, and stiffness required for long-span enclosure at this scale. This system enables large clear spans while maintaining structural integrity, serviceability, and material efficiency.

## Project Significance

The 042 Arena stands as a definitive example of large-scale arena engineering, combining underground parking infrastructure, long-span roof systems, challenging soil conditions, expansion-jointed structural planning, and high-capacity crowd accommodation into a single, well-resolved design. It is a project that demonstrates the firm's ability to deliver complex, globally competitive event infrastructure with precision, foresight, and confidence.
